The very franticness of attempts to reestablish community and festival, by partying, by groups, by club, by touristy Mardi Gras, is the best evidence of the loss of true community and festival and of the loneliness of self, stranded as it is as an unspeakable consciousness in a world from which it perceives itself as somehow estranged, stranded even within its own body, with which it sees no clear connection. The very word boredom does not exist in any premodern language, it did not enter the language until the eighteenth century. No one knows its etymology."}	1364192568
13	1	{"name":"Walker Percy","quote":"The typical 4-year-old tends to be rather a joy. His enthusiasm, his exuberance, his willingness to go more than halfway to meet others in a spirit of fun are all refreshing... He is basically highly positive, enthusiastic, appreciative. This makes him fun to be with, an engaging, amusing, ever-challenging friend. Fours enjoy each other, they appreciate the challenge that other children offer. This is an age at which children interest and admire each other most... The four year old is a concelebrant of the world and even of his own peers.\\n\\nThe seven-year-old? Something has happened in the interval. More aware of and withdrawn into self... Seems to be in 'another world'... Self-conscious about own body. Sensitive about exposing body. Does not like to be touched. Modest about toileting... Protects self by withdrawal. May be unwilling to expose knowledge, for fear of being laughed at or criticized... Apt to expect too much of self."}	1364192578

21	1	{"name":"Richard La Ruina (Gambler)","quote":"The next milestone happened one night when I was at a trendy dance club. The friend I was with identified a hot girl. She was tall, blond, and thin, with blue eyes--just my type. I went over and sat down next to her and started chatting away. After some teasing banter to challenge her, I lightly touched her leg and arm, and she reciprocated. I went for the kiss after about five minutes. Then I led her around the club: \\u201cLet\\u2019s go get a drink\\u201d became \\u201cLet\\u2019s dance,\\u201d which then became \\u201cLet\\u2019s sit down.\\u201d We got quite hot and heavy on the sidelines, and then I just got up, took her hand, and said, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d She walked with me, asking only, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d I said, \\u201cSomewhere else,\\u201d and led her out of the club and over to my place."}	1364278826
22	1	{"name":"Richard La Ruina (Gambler)","quote":"An attractive man is one who has a strong sense of self: a man who likes himself, trusts himself, and is confident in his own ability to act effectively in the world. At the room of his psychology is a strong set of beliefs--about himself, about how other people should treat him, and about what he is entitled to.

24	1	{"name":"Richard La Ruina (Gambler)","quote":"Most guys fidget. They\\u2019re nervous, and it shows. Their weight shifts from leg to leg. When they\\u2019re out at a bar, they hold their drinks up close to their chest and frequently take sips. They don\\u2019t take up much physical space, literally. And that\\u2019s when they\\u2019re by themselves. When they talk to women and other men, it gets worse: they\\u2019re afraid to touch, gesture, or show much expression--on top of the nervous movements already described. All of these are nonverbal signs of low status."}	1364278894
25	1	{"name":"Richard La Ruina (Gambler)","quote":"There is a little loophole in human psychology: whoever is most certain wins. In other words, when multiple people have multiple ideas or viewpoints, the person who believes most certainly that he or she is correct will generally win out and influence others. Those who have relatively little in the way of an opinion will look to the person who is most certain to make decisions for them. Just realizing this one simple fact makes a world of difference. Approach the world with the idea that \\u201cwhoever is most certain wins,\\u201d and you will find that you get very different results."}	1364278914

The more beautiful the woman, the more she\\u2019s used to being given all the status. A deferential man will ask her to make decisions on everything, from whether it\\u2019s okay to take her phone number and when she\\u2019s available to meet, to where she would like to go, whether his clothes are okay, and if the food at a proposed restaurant is good. This is actually unattractive. It\\u2019s so common for men to give away all their power like this that the rare man who doesn\\\\'t is prized."}	1364278929

85	1	{"name":"Brian Greene","quote":"You see we learned that our universe is not static that space is expanding and that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies. But because the expansion is speeding up in the very far future those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we won\\\\'t be able to see them not because of technological limitations but because of the laws of physics. The light those galaxies emit even traveling at the fastest speed, the speed of light, will not be able to overcome the ever widening gulf between us. So astronomers in the far future looking out into deep space will see nothing but an endless stretch of static inky black stillness and they will conclude that the Universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit. A picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong. Know maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era, like ours, attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies but would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge or would they believe in the black static empty Universe that their own state of the art observations reveal. I suspect the later. Which means that we are living through a remarkably privileged era. When certain deep truths about the cosmos are still within reach of the human spirit of exploration it appears that it may not always be that way. Because today\\\\'s astronomers by turning powerful telescopes to the sky have captured a handful of starkly informative photons a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit and the message echoing across the ages is clear. Sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law. Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon."}	1364280477

89	1	{"name":"Neil deGrasse Tyson","quote":"Again and again across the centuries, cosmic discoveries have demoted our self-image. Earth was once assumed to be astronomically unique, until astronomers learned that Earth is just another planet orbiting the Sun.

Then we presumed our galaxy, the Milky Way, was the entire known universe, until we established that the countless fuzzy things in the sky are other galaxies, dotting the landscape of our known universe. Today, how easy it is to presume that one universe is all there is. Yet emerging theories of modern cosmology, as well as the continually reaffirmed improbability that anything is unique, require that we remain open to the latest assault on our plea for distinctiveness: multiple universes, otherwise known as the \\u201cmultiverse,\\u201d in which ours is just one of countless bubbles bursting forth from the fabric of the cosmos."}	1364280523

94	1	{"name":"Professor Brian Cox","quote":"In this diamond there are 3 million billion billion carbon atoms. So this is a diamond size box of carbon atoms. And there\\\\'s the thing the Pauli exclusion principle still applies. So all the energy levels in all those 3 million billion billion atoms have to be slightly different in order to ensure that none of the electrons sit in precisely the same energy level. Pauli\\\\'s principle holds fast but it doesn\\\\'t stop with the diamond. See, you can think of the whole universe as a vast box of atoms with countless numbers of energy levels all filled by countless numbers of electrons. So here\\\\'s the amazing thing. The exclusion principle still applies so none of the electrons in the universe can sit in precisely the same energy level. But that must mean something very odd. See let me take this diamond and let me just heat it up a little bit between my hands just gently warming it up. I\\\\'m putting a bit of energy into it so I\\\\'m shifting the electrons around some of the electrons are jumping into different energy levels. But this shift in the configuration of the electrons inside the diamond has consequences because the sum total of all the electrons in the universe must respect Pauli. Therefore every electron around every atom in the universe must be shifting as I heat the diamond up to make sure that none of them end up in the same energy level. When I heat this diamond up all the electrons across the universe instantly but imperceptibly change their energy levels. So everything is connected to everything else."}	1364280583
